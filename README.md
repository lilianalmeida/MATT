# MATT

MATT is a friend that reminds you of how you would rather spend your time. It gives you a small boost of inspiration to nudge you in the right direction. Matt also gives you recommendation troughout the day. It is always there for you!


## Why
_“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”_ - Will Durant

Many of us have a vision of who we wish to be. Maybe you have dreams about reading loads of books? Maybe you have a big interest in meditation, but haven’t gotten to actually trying it?

At the end of the day, it might just feel like time has slipped away, but many of us waste hours a day on our phones doing things that won’t get us any closer to who we wish to be. Sometimes picking up our phones can be more autopilot than a conscious choice. It’s easy to fall into the trap of social media algorithms and lose hours in a day. What if there was something to nudge you to put the phone down and do something that brings you value?
